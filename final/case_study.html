        <h1>Case Study</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, I was to create a complex micro-interaction to add to a page of my choice. In my 
                case, I used Musescore.org, specifically the download button that appears on the details page for each
                 piece. In ten weeks, I added parts to my micro-interaction by first designing each action and then 
                 using the design as a base point to code out a working build. In my work, I made a confetti animation 
                 that plays when hovering on the “download” button, a modal that pops up when you click it, and a 
                 download animation that plays when you choose a file format to download. In the end, I came out with 
                 a successful build that makes the process of downloading a piece much more interesting and satisfying 
                 for the user.</p>

            <h2>Context and Challenges</h2>
            <p class="case">For my project, I was to create a complex micro-interaction over the course of 10 weeks. 
                The purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding of how to make a simple interaction on 
                a page (such as hitting a button or loading a page) feel more satisfying for the user.
            In my case, I was working by myself on a micro-interaction for a website called Musescore.org. This site 
            offers users the opportunity to find sheet music from any genre and for any instrument. My particular 
            focus for the project was the interaction of downloading the sheet music.
            When I first saw the page, I tried clicking on the button. The look of the page was fine, but I found 
            the interaction to be a bit boring and it didn’t really leave a lasting impression on me. Therefore, 
            my goal with this project became making the process of downloading sheet music fun and memorable for 
            the user without getting in the way or causing the user to wait through long animations. The main factors 
            that needed to call the project done included; having all of my animations functioning, writing a detailed 
            description of the whole interaction, and having the interaction that I code match with the description that 
            I write.

            <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
            <div class="process">
                <img class="images" src="images/Step 2.png" alt="Step 2">
                <p>To start, I designed the general look of the first animation that I wanted, which was a music note 
                confetti animation that would play when you hover on the download button. I decided to go with it 
                being on hover because it was the best time to see it for the user. Clicking on the button was 
                planned to open a modal at this point, so if you click there would be no way to see it. I also 
                wrote a description of what should happen in the interaction, which would later help to define the 
                goals this initial phase of the project.</p>

                <img class="images" src="images/AlphaBuild.png" alt="Alpha">
                <p>After this, built out the interaction I described. I used a working sample from user Daisy on 
                Codepen for a start on how to code out the interaction. Coding this sample into my page was a 
                challenge, specifically because I had to really dig into the code for the animations to find a way 
                to put the line on each of the notes, as the user just had circles for their confetti. I was able 
                to accomplish this mostly through trial and error, changing each setting to see what moves or 
                changes what. It gave me a deeper understanding of how Daisy made the code and how I could do it 
                in the future.</p>

                <img class="images" src="images/Step 15.png" alt="Step 14">
                <p>For the next phase, I wanted to implement a modal animation. When you download sheet music from 
                Musescore.org, they have a modal that asks you what format you’d like to download (PDF, MIDI, etc.). 
                This was a good place to add in animation because I thought it would make more sense for the modal 
                to grow outward from the button, as the website just has it fade in from the center of the screen. 
                This would make it more clear that the modal is meant to be connected to the process of downloading 
                sheet music.</p>

                <img class="images big" src="images/BetaBuild.png" alt="Beta">
                <p>When I was building this part of the micro-interaction, I used a working sample from another user of 
                Codepen, Ettrics. This sample had a few different examples of the modal, but what I liked was that 
                you could see the modal come out from the button. The main challenge with coding this part 
                implementing it and making it responsive. The Javascript file for this sample was longer and much more 
                complex, so I had to read through it carefully to understand what each thing did. A technique that 
                helped me was taking a picture of the variables as they were defined in the beginning of the code, and 
                looking at it as I read the code so I wouldn’t get lost and have to keep scrolling up and down to see 
                what each variable is.</p>

            <div class="process">
                <img class="images" src="images/Step 9.png" alt="Step 8">
                <p>The last phase was to finish the project out by showing a downloading animation when the user picks a 
                file type to download. At the time of this project, there is no particular animation that happens when 
                you download a file. This was an opportunity to give the user something to look at when waiting for the 
                file to download that will leave a lasting impression.</p>

            <div class="processRev">
                <img class="images big" src="images/FinalBuild.png" alt="Final">
                <p>Building this phase out was probably the hardest. I took a bit to find a sample before deciding to work 
                with a downloading animation made by Matthew Sechrest on Codepen. The challenge here was that this 
                sample didn’t use any Javascript, and it was activated by clicking an icon which would check a box. 
                This meant that I needed to go through and figure out how to make the animations activate without the 
                checkbox, then figure out how to activate it with the buttons in the modal and make it disappear when 
                the animation was done. This part required a lot of patience, and I needed a lot of help from my 
                professor, as well as friends and of course, Google.</p>

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <a href="http://parkerishere.com/IDM241/Final/build/"><p>Link to the final product</p></a>
            <p>My final micro-interaction has a “download” button at the top. This is the build that I made over the 
                course of the ten weeks. Hovering on the button will show a quick music note confetti animation that adds 
                a bit of flair right at the beginning of your journey with the button. Clicking it will cause a modal to 
                expand out from the button, giving you a few options for how you want to download the piece. This clearly 
                shows you that the modal is linked to the action of downloading a piece, as well as just making it a bit 
                more intriguing to look at. Finally, clicking on any option gives you a downloading animation. This will 
                play all the way through and disappear when it’s finished, letting you know that your download is done and 
                that the button has successfully helped you achieve your goals. At the bottom of the page is a description 
                of what will happen when you interact with it.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>In the end, I found that my project was successful. My interaction works and is consistent with the 
                description that I set. Furthermore, I feel that my interaction adds personality to the page and makes the 
                interface a lot more memorable and satisfying. There are more things for the user to see that add intrigue. 
                For instance, the hover effect where the confetti animation plays adds a fun aspect to the process of 
                downloading a piece that before was more of an average interaction. This means that the user is more likely 
                to come back and download more music when they need it. 
                I’ve also learned a lot, specifically that you don’t have to code everything on a page on your own all the 
                time. Sometimes, it can be better to just take a sample from a page or a build that someone else has made and 
                use it as a starting point for your work. Also, I’ve seen that you have to be very patient with code 
                sometimes and make sure you know what every part of the code does. I had many times where something wasn’t 
                working and I had to really dig into the code to understand what part of it is messing up.
